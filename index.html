                <p>
                    I started learning to code when I was 27 years old because I wanted 
                    to make my own creative web and mobile applications. Over time, 
                    I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing 
                    both web and mobile apps.

                <h3>Mohit Solanki â€“ A Gamer by Heart ðŸŽ®</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Mohit Solanki, and for me, gaming is not just a hobby â€“ 
                    itâ€™s an emotion. I started playing games when I was around 10 years old, 
                    and since then, it has been an incredible journey. In my childhood, 
                    I grew up playing classics like Mario, Contra, Duck Hunt, and Tekken 3, 
                    along with bike and car racing games.  
                    Today, Iâ€™m a huge fan of PC games, especially the Far Cry series.  
                    I also enjoy mobile games like Free Fire, PUBG, and Warzone.  
                    Recently, Iâ€™ve also started playing the Demon Slayer game, and the 
                    experience is next level. Gaming has taught me creativity, patience, 
                    and strategy â€“ itâ€™s a world where I truly feel like myself.  
                    Aakhir mein sirf itna hi kahunga â€“ ab game ho ya zindagiâ€¦  
                    **PHOOK DENGE SABKO! ðŸ”¥**
